# TrelloApp

Trello App is a backbone on rails application inspired by Trello. In this web
app, the user is able to drag and drog items as they wish with using the
jquery UI sortable function. Sorting lists and to-do cards have never been easier!
In order to demo this app please click [here]

On the start screen, you can see a compilation of all boards from different
users.

![start]

The user will be be able to access their own board by clicking on the boards
name and also view their lists. On his or her board, the user can make a
new list or delete a current list. Each list is presented by a grey block.

![block]

A user will also be able to move their to-do card into another list.

![movecard]

If a user needs to delete a card, the user can hover over the selected card,
which will reveal the delete button.

![deletecard]
